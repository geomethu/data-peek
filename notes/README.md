## Creating a New Post

1. Create a new `.mdx` file in this folder
2. Add frontmatter at the top:

```yaml
---
title: "Your Post Title"
description: "Brief description for SEO and previews"
date: "YYYY-MM-DD"
author: "Rohith Gilla"
tags: ["Tag1", "Tag2"]
published: true  # Set to false to keep as draft
---
```

3. Write your content in MDX (Markdown + JSX)
4. The post will appear on `/blog` when `published: true`

## Draft Posts

Set `published: false` in frontmatter to keep a post as a draft. It won't appear on the blog until you change it to `true`.
